# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React, following the official [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). It demonstrates key React concepts such as components, state management, and event handling.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Two players can take turns playing the game by clicking on the board squares.
- **Winner Detection**: The game announces the winner when a player gets three in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Draw Detection**: If all squares are filled and no winner is detected, the game ends in a draw.
- **Time Travel Feature**: Players can go back to any previous move in the game's history and view the game state at that time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-react.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd tic-tac-toe-react
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Project
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the game in action.

Building for Production
To build the app for production:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This creates an optimized version of your project in the build folder, ready for deployment.

How to Play
The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
Player X goes first and marks one of the squares by clicking on it.
The players take turns marking empty squares until one player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, or the game ends in a draw if all squares are filled.
Learnings from the Project
This project covers several important React concepts:

Component Structure: Building modular UI components.
State Management: Using useState to track game state.
Props: Passing data from parent to child components.
Event Handling: Handling click events to modify the game state.
Conditional Rendering: Displaying different UI elements based on the game state.
Time Travel: Storing the game’s move history and allowing users to revisit earlier moves.
Deployment
You can deploy this project to services like Netlify or Vercel by following their deployment instructions for React projects.
